Check it out at https://bronxtaco.itch.io/rays-of-giza

Made by myself and Tim 'BronxTaco' Day. Its a simple one level platformer we pulled together in a few days.
Since it was our first time working together in a jam, also first time with Godot, 
our aim for the jam was to learn a lot and have some fun. Which we definitely achieved :D
